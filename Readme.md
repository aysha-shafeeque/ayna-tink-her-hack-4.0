### Project Description
[Planyx – Smart Study Planner
A web app to organize your study schedule by subject, deadline, and difficulty. It generates a daily calendar with timers, tracks progress, supports dark mode, and lets you export your plan as a PDF.]

### The Problem statement
[Students often struggle to plan their study schedule efficiently, balance multiple subjects, and track progress toward deadlines. Existing methods like notebooks or simple apps lack automated time allocation, priority-based scheduling, and progress tracking, making it hard to stay organized and productive.]

### The Solution
[Planyx lets students add subjects with deadlines and difficulty levels, then automatically generates a daily calendar with time allocation, interactive timers, progress tracking, and PDF export for easy planning and review.]

## Implementation

### For Software:

#### Installation
```bash
[doesn’t require installation like a backend app. You just need a browser to run it.if you want to set it up locally:# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# 2. Navigate to the project folder
cd Planyx

# 3. Open index.html in a web browser
# (double-click or use a live server extension in VS Code)]
```

#### Run
```bash
[You can run it directly in a browser.
# 1. Navigate to the project folder
cd Planyx

# 2. Open index.html in your default browser
# On Windows
start index.html

# On Mac
open index.html

# On Linux
xdg-open index.html]
```

### For Hardware:

#### Components Required
[The Planyx web app can run on any modern computer with a CPU like Intel i3 or AMD Ryzen 3, 2–4 GB RAM, 100 MB free storage, a display with at least 1024×768 resolution, standard keyboard and mouse, and an internet connection to load libraries.]

#### Circuit Setup
[Planyx is a web-based software app, so there’s no physical circuit or hardware setup needed. You don’t need to wire or assemble anything—everything runs in a browser on your computer.]

### For Mobile Apps:

#### Installation Guide

**For Android (APK):**
1.there is no Android APK or installation guide for Planyx.

Open the project URL or index.html in a browser like Chrome.
Optionally, use “Add to Home Screen” in Chrome to create a shortcut that behaves like an app.No APK file or Android-specific installation is needed.
**For iOS (IPA) - TestFlight:**
1.Similarly, for iOS, there is no APK or native app—Planyx is purely web-based.
To use it on iPhone or iPad:
Open the app URL or index.html in Safari.
Tap the Share button → Add to Home Screen.
This creates a shortcut on your home screen that opens Planyx like an app.
No App Store installation or iOS-specific setup is required.

**Building from Source:**
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# 2. Navigate to the project folder
cd Planyx

# 3. Open index.html in your default browser
# On Windows
start index.html

# On Mac
open index.html

# On Linux
xdg-open index.html
